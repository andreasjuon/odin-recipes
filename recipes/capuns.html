    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Capuns are a traditional Swiss dish from the canton of Graubünden, combining hearty flavors with rustic elegance. 
        To make Capuns, start by preparing the dough: mix 200g of flour with two eggs, a splash of milk, and a pinch of salt to create a thick batter. 
        Stir in finely chopped ingredients—about 100g of dried meat (like Bündnerfleisch or prosciutto), a handful of parsley, chives, and mint. 
        Then, take fresh Swiss chard leaves, blanch them quickly in boiling water, and pat them dry. 
        Place a spoonful of the filling onto each leaf, fold in the sides, and roll them up neatly like small parcels.</p>

    <p>In a large pan, melt a knob of butter and arrange the Capuns in a single layer. 
        Pour over 200ml of a light broth (vegetable or chicken), cover, and simmer gently for about 15–20 minutes until cooked through. 
        To finish, drizzle with cream and sprinkle grated cheese (such as Gruyère) over the top, letting it melt into the sauce. 
        Serve hot, ideally with crusty bread to mop up the delicious, savory juices.</p>
